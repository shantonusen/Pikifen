    <p><i>Date TBD</i></p>
    
    <p><b>Gameplay changes</b></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Added Rock Pikmin.
        <ul>
          <li>When thrown at an enemy, they cause damage when they collide, and then bounce back.</li>
          <li>They also lunge forward on their own when they get close to an enemy they are chasing on foot. This impact works just like a throw, bounce back included.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Added Winged Pikmin.
        <ul>
          <li>If their target is above or below them, they can move up and down in the air to get to it.</li>
          <li>When following a leader, they try to stay a bit above the leader, and when idling, they also try to idle some distance above-ground.</li>
          <li>Because they are flying in the air when following a leader, they can travel over bodies of water. That said, leaders that are underwater can't grab or throw them.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Added Bulbmin. They are invulnerable to all elemental hazards, but lack an Onion or ship to go to.</li>
      <li>Added pellets, Pellet Posies, Candypop Buds, and Onions for the new Pikmin types, including Pellet Posies, Candypop Buds, and Onions that support multiple Pikmin types.</li>
      <li>Pikmin will now only take paths that they can survive. e.g. a carcass with 1 Red Pikmin and 9 Blue Pikmin carrying it will take a path that doesn't go through water, but a carcass carried by 10 Blue Pikmin might take that water path.</li>
      <li>Objects now move with acceleration. This should make them a bit smoother when moving.</li>
      <li>
        Revamped the cursor.
        <ul>
          <li>The leader cursor's color now matches the standby Pikmin's color. If there is none, it uses a faded cyan color.</li>
          <li>The number of Pikmin of the standby type now also appears next to the cursor.</li>
          <li>There is now a line connecting the leader to the cursor. When the leader has a group member, the line changes to represent a preview of how that member would be thrown. This helps to show which ledges can and can't be reached.</li>
          <li>Added an option to set the cursor's speed, used when controlling it without a mouse. (Thanks MonkeyUhOh)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If a Pikmin is lying down, a leader can now whistle it to make it get up faster, and return to the leader once it does.</li>
      <li>Added an option to allow the leader to auto-throw. If you have trouble mashing the throw button, consider turning this on.</li>
      <li>If a new leader shows up from a defeated enemy, their HUD information will now display properly. (Thanks pikminjosh)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Content making changes</b></p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        Rock Pikmin-related features:
        <ul>
          <li>Added a property for Pikmin types, <code>attack_method</code>, that controls how the Pikmin attacks. If set to <code>impact</code>, that Pikmin attacks like a Rock Pikmin, as explained above.</li>
          <li>These Pikmin should have attack hitboxes in the throwing animation on top of the regular ones.</li>
          <li>Their on-foot lunges use the attack animation, so it should ideally be in a pose where they lunge forward, and have a hitbox.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Winged Pikmin-related features:
        <ul>
          <li>Added a property for Pikmin types, <code>can_fly</code>, that makes a Pikmin fly like a Winged Pikmin, as explained above.</li>
          <li>These Pikmin can only move vertically if the state they are in allows it (e.g. they can't fly if they're being knocked back).</li>
          <li>Technically, if a leader is on a floor with a hazard (liquid or otherwise), they will be unable to grab Pikmin that are outside it and are vulnerable to the hazard. If they grab and bring those Pikmin to said floor, the Pikmin will suffer the effects.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Revamped paths.
        <ul>
          <li>If a path stop is on top of a sector with hazards, objects will now be unable to traverse it if they are vulnerable to the hazards. In the case of a carried object, this applies to the carrier Pikmin. If there is another path, they will take it, otherwise they will stay stuck in front of that path stop. If the hazard is only on the floor, and the object or carrier Pikmin can fly, then they will still take that path.</li>
          <li>Path links now have a type. "Normal" works like normal, "custom only" can only be used by objects that need that path for scripting, "light load only" can only be taken by objects carrying a weight of 1 or nothing, and "airborne only" can only be taken by flying objects.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Revamped the status system.
        <ul>
          <li>Object types, in their hazard vulnerability data and spike damage vulnerability data, can now be told to receive a status effect when interacting with one.</li>
          <li>Added the <code>remove_on_hazard_leave</code> property. This is now used for statuses like drowning, where the status effect is removed once the object leaves the hazard that was applying the status effect.</li>
          <li>Status effects can now change the object's state when applied. For this, the <code>state_change_type</code> and <code>state_change_name</code> properties have been created.</li>
          <li>They can now also change the object's animation when applied, with the <code>animation_change</code> property.</li>
          <li>Plus other changes noted below in the compatibility warnings.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Added the <code>no_pikmin_color</code> property to the game configuration, to control the color the cursor shows when no Pikmin are available.</li>
      <li>Added the <code>acceleration</code> property to control an object type's acceleration.</li>
      <li>The maximum distances at which the leader can whistle or throw can now be set in <code>Game_data/Misc/Config.txt</code>.</li>
      <li>The <code>on_hitbox_touch_a_n</code> event used to trigger regardless of the first hitbox's type. This has now been fixed, and <code>on_hitbox_touch_n_n</code> was created for when the both hitboxes are of the normal type.</li>
      <li>
        Minor editor tweaks.
        <ul>
          <li>In the animation editor's sprite or animation picker, the buttons now shows thumbnails of the sprite or the animation's first frame.</li>
          <li>Double-clicking in the area editor while in object editing mode now creates a new object where you clicked.</li>
          <li>In the area editor, you can now specify a different horizontal and vertical scale, when resizing everything.</li>
          <li>Revamped the area editor's problem finder.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Custom content compatibility warnings</b></p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        In order for Pikmin to get up when whistled, their states and animations relating to knockback had to be changed. This results in the following animation changes:
        <ul>
          <li><code>lying</code> is now just the Pikmin lying down forever.</li>
          <li><code>knocked_back</code> is a new animation for the Pikmin getting knocked back forever.</li>
          <li><code>getting_up</code> is a new animation for the Pikmin getting up from lying down.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Status effect changes:
        <ul>
          <li>Turned the <code>disabled_state_inedible</code> status effect type property to <code>turns_inedible</code> instead. This way, any status can make a Pikmin inedible while under its effects.</li>
          <li>The <code>causes_*</code> status effect type properties were removed in favor of the <code>state_change_type</code> property. Anything related to the Pikmin's "disabled" state has now also been renamed to the more apt term "helpless".</li>
          <li>The <code>on_hitbox_touch_a_n</code> event was corrected, so if you relied on the incorrect behavior, use <code>on_hitbox_touch_n_n</code> instead.</li>
          <li>The <code>animation</code> and <code>animation_mob_scale</code> properties have been renamed to <code>overlay_animation</code> and <code>overlay_anim_mob_scale</code>, respectively.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Converters now need hitboxes for the Pikmin to touch when thrown.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 id="0.20.0">0.20.0</h2>
    
    <p><i>April 24th, 2021</i></p>
    
    <p><b>Changes</b></p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        Revamped Onions.
        <ul>
          <li>Interacting with an Onion now displays a menu to manage the Pikmin with.</li>
          <li>Pikmin now have logic to climb up an Onion's legs and enter, or to come out and slide down a leg.</li>
          <li>An Onion can now manage multiple Pikmin types, not just one.</li>
          <li>Ships can now store and manage Pikmin, just like Onions.</li>
          <li>The pre-packaged Onion graphics now animate, and look like the more modern Onion designs.</li>
          <li>Added a new Onion type that manages all three &ndash; the Master Onion.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Added a results screen.
        <ul>
          <li>When the player finishes playing in an area, the results screen gives them some basic stats: time taken, treasure points obtained, treasure points available, enemies killed, enemies available, Pikmin born, and Pikmin deaths.</li>
          <li>The player is also given the option to retry, keep playing after hours, or pick a different area.</li>
          <li>The results screen is entered when the player chooses to end the day via the pause menu, when the day time is over, or when all leaders are KO.
          <li>Added a new property for treasure types: <code>points</code>. Use this to specify how many points they are worth.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Added a pause menu. Players can retry, end the day, or quit to the area selection menu from here.</li>
      <li>
        Revamped GUI.
        <ul>
          <li>Updated all menus to have a better and more unified look.</li>
          <li>The position of GUI items in all menus can now be customized, just like the HUD was customizable until now.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Revamped edge aesthetics.
        <ul>
          <li>You can go to the area editor, select edges, and edit their properties.</li>
          <li>With this, you can control how and if walls cast a shadow, as well as their color and length. (Thanks Scruffy, Neo)</li>
          <li>You can also now make the higher sector of a wall look smooth at the ledge, instead of the ledge abruptly cutting off to the lower sector. (Thanks Tenacious)</li>
          <li>Finally, bodies of water will now have a simple foam effect around their limits.</li>
          <li>Wall shadows have been revamped to work better in general.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Expanded the <code>get_info</code> action:
        <ul>
          <li>Added new data: <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code>. Use these to get the object's coordinates. (Thanks Kman)</li>
          <li>Also added <code>focus_distance</code>. Use this to get the distance between this object and its focused object.</li>
          <li>Added a new action: <code>get_focus_info</code>. It works like <code>get_info</code>, but when applicable, gets info from the focused mob instead. (Thanks Kman)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Added a mob script event, <code>on_leave_hazard</code>, and added a way to get the name of the hazard via the <code>get_info</code> action, both for this event and <code>on_touch_hazard</code>. (Thanks Kman)</li>
      <li>Pikmin now push each other slightly.</li>
      <li>Health wheels now transition smoothly to their target value, and also fade away when they are empty. (Thanks Kman)</li>
      <li>Added new system assets: <code>bubble_box</code>, used to draw box-like bubbles in the HUD and menus, <code>focus_box</code>, used to show which GUI item is focused, and <code>more</code>, used for menus to indicate there's more content beyond.</li>
      <li>Holding Shift when the snapping mode is "nothing" will now snap to the grid in the area editor. The snapping mode is now also saved to the options. Finally, Shift+Plus and Shift+Minus change the grid spacing. (Thanks Nutty171, Neo)</li>
      <li>Players can now customize the colors of the GUI widgets in the editors. (Thanks Kman)</li>
      <li>The Beady Long Legs's logic was slightly cleaned up.</li>
      <li>Revamped code and added instructions to make it possible to compile on Mac OS. (Thanks MidnightWhisper)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><b>Compatibility warnings</b></p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Onion types now use the <code>pikmin_types</code> property instead of <code>pikmin_type</code>.</li>
      <li>The mouse cursor graphic now displays at full-size, all the time. If you made a custom one, you'll probably want to resize its image file to 70% its old size.</li>
      <li>The pre-packaged Pellet Posy graphics files are now split per-type, as opposed to per-size. This makes more sense for adding new types of Pikmin/pellet. (Thanks Kman)</li>
      <li>The counter font now also includes a dot and a colon. If you changed this font, please update it accordingly.</li>
      <li>The gameplay HUD information is now stored in <code>Game_data/GUI/Gameplay.txt</code>, and the title screen logo information now goes in <code>Game_data/GUI/Main_menu.txt</code>.</li>
      <li>The sector property "always casts shadow" has been removed, and wall shadows should be slightly less dark than before in general. If you have walls that you need to look the same as before, you'll want to go to the edge properties and tweak their shadow's length and color.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 id="0.19.0">0.19.0</h2>
    
    <p><i>August 15th, 2020</i></p>
    
    <p><b>Changes</b></p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        Revamped editors
        <ul>
          <li>The GUI now uses Dear ImGui.</li>
          <li>More information fits in a single panel now, and the user can open or close parts of the panel at will (this is memorized between sessions).</li>
          <li>Information on widgets is now shown via (toggleable) tooltips, instead of the status bar.</li>
          <li>The way some things are done has been changed to be more streamlined. e.g.: picking a texture now shows a dedicated dialog, renaming animations is now done in-place in the animation panel.</li>
          <li>If you select an object that can change its behavior thanks to certain script vars, the panel will now show widgets that let you tweak those properties yourself, instead of having to write script vars by hand.</li>
          <li>Objects with certain tricks to them (e.g. they must be linked to another mob) will now show tips in the object panel, when you select them.</li>
          <li>Edges can now be deleted, which will delete and/or merge sectors. (Thanks Neo)</li>
          <li>Drawing a sector now only requires drawing the missing edges, instead of all edges. This also means you can now split a sector into two easily.</li>
          <li>The animation editor now has a grid too, and animations have a simple timeline.</li>
          <li>Added a way to resize a sprite, resizing hitboxes and all. Useful for creating smaller copies of existing sprites. (Thanks Kman)</li>
          <li>Added a way to resize and rotate selected vertexes together; enable it in the area editor options.</li>
          <li>Several other small things have been tweaked.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Added a performance monitor to the maker tools (previous known as "creator tools"). When active, every time you play an area, the loading times and every frame of gameplay get monitored, and a report file gets written when you leave. It can help you figure out what the heaviest parts of your content are.</li>
      <li>Added a way to add actions, events, and states to object types that have hardcoded scripts.</li>
      <li>If you're missing a Pikmin type/leader type in the Pikmin order/leader order, in the game's configuration file, an error is no longer issued; the missing types just go to the end. (Thanks Kman)</li>
      <li>Fixed thrown Pikmin getting stuck in some walls, and the Beady Long Legs floating in the air.</li>
      <li>Fixed cardboard boxes not blocking the way if they are not in place, but for this to work, you'll need to use a "Dummy obstacle target" object as a target.</li>
      <li>Fixed a few miscellaneous glitches. (Thanks Kman)</li>
      <li>Refactored a bunch of code to be more organized and hopefully a bit less buggy. (Thanks Ambrosia)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><b>Compatibility warnings</b></p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>The <code>is_obstacle</code> property has been removed. Use the <code>team</code> property instead to change an object type's starting team, and set that to the "obstacle" team if you want.</li>
      <li>
        "Group move" has been renamed to "swarm". This affects the following:
        <ul>
          <li><code>Group_move_arrow.png</code> in the graphics folder was renamed to <code>Swarm_arrow.png</code>.</li>
          <li>The property <code>group_move_arrow</code> in the system asset file names file was renamed to <code>swarm_arrow</code>.</li>
          <li>The config file property <code>group_move_task_range</code> was renamed to <code>swarm_task_range</code>.</li>
          <li>The controls for group control were renamed to <code>swarm_right</code>, <code>swarm_up</code>, <code>swarm_left</code>, <code>swarm_down</code>, and <code>swarm_cursor</code>. Please re-bind them in the options.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><code>pikmin_grab_range</code> in the game configuration file has been renamed to <code>group_member_grab_range</code>.</li>
      <li>
        Some definitions have been changed from being all lumped into a single file, to being spread over several files in a folder. This should allow makers to share their content more easily by only including new files, thus avoiding replacing the files players already had.
        <ul>
          <li>The following have been affected: hazards, liquids, particle generators, spike damage types, spray types, status effects, weather conditions.</li>
          <li>In addition, added the <code>spray_order</code> property to the game configuration file; use this to set the standard order of sprays.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Some file name logic was changed to sanitize the file names. This is to make it so you can still save an area called "Secret?", for instance, since otherwise the question mark would be illegal. That said, if one of your areas fails to load, try changing its folder name to something simpler (letters, numbers, spaces, dashes, and underscores allowed).</li>
      <li>If you made an area and wrote down your creator name in the "Info" section, you'll need to write it again, since the property "creator" got renamed to "maker".</li>
    </ul>
