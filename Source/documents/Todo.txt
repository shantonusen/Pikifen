Point I left on (so I can continue the next day without losing my train of thought)
    
    
Current tasks (tasks being worked on, but not yet committed)
    Bridge improvements
        The ability to specify the construction end-point
        Move the bridge object along every chunk as it's created
        Customize number of chunks
        Optimize chunks by stretching a component
        Add an object for bridges to build towards, instead of the user having to specify the length
        Improve the way ceramic bridge textures work
        Verticality
            If going vertically, some segments will almost forcefully be inside a wall -- is this ok?
        If a path stop is above water, Pikmin should still want to take it if a built bridge is there, right?
        Old thoughts
            Make bridges open sectors gradually
                If the bridge object has a parameter "halfway", it should only open half the bridge sectors. This makes it possible to have two bridges connect to one another from opposite ends. (thanks Kman)
            Maybe make them objects entirely? Should work fine for forward-facing bridges, but ramped ones might be tougher
                Maybe each segment is a sub-object? This way, you could specify how many segments to create, and segments could even go up or down, but think of the performance penalty
                Maybe a mob with unique behavior that changes width/height as it's built, and builds the texture dynamically? This would work, except for sloped bridges, and we pretty much can't NOT have sloped bridges
                Maybe a hybrid solution: the bridge is split into segments, created dynamically. For a level bridge, it's just one segment, stretched to whatever length necessary. For sloped bridges, it's divided into equal-length segments, each segment 50 higher/lower than the previous
    
Next tasks (roughly sorted most important first)
    
    --- To fix ---
    
    
    --- v0.22.0 ---
    Details
        Make White Pikmin inflict a "poisoned" status effect upon enemies that saps away health over time
        "quick suggestion that should take like 10 seconda. put a random timer in the dwarf bulborb, cause all of them moving at the same time is weird / same with every mob that moves like it" (thanks Kman)
        Dwarf Red Bulborbs should scream to wake up nearby Red Bulborbs
        Should the Beady Long Legs's feet be damageable? It can give some life to the fight, but newbies might think that's the only way to cause damage
        Decorative objects shouldn't cast light in blackout mode
        Add logic for Pikmin to detect an object is close by when it's rectangular -- maybe just for obstacles
        Maybe each object should have a terrain collision radius, and an inter-mob collision radius. This would stop some of the beefier mobs from visually going inside walls
        On an object that can carry other objects, if you have a leader and their Pikmin, the Pikmin will kinda jerk along, not very smoothly
        Every time a Pikmin is meant to attack without latching, there should be a chance that it circles around the enemy for a random time, before it goes for the attack
        A leader can whistle another from a gate and grab them
        Improve the look of the ship's ring
        As a day progresses, mob shadows should become invisible long before sunlight ends. During twilight there are no shadows, but there's still visibility
        Make the whistle look prettier and more like a mix between the classic and the new whistle
            Suggestion: Make the light rings not be ugly circles, but sprites instead
            Add a transparent solid circle over the area being whistled
        Smoother trail behind the mouse cursor
        Health wheels should be slightly transparent
        Give more juice to the HUD (Kman)
            Every GUI item should just have a "juice timer", not a "juicy grow timer"
            Leader swapping should make the leader health items slide into place
        The GUI left-right option swapper should tint the left or right arrow blue when the mouse is nearest to it
        Maybe decrease the territory radius of the pre-packaged enemies? (thanks Nutty171)
        Game feel

            https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/b6gh70/common_gamedev_mistakes_part_of_my_job_is_to/
    Performance
        Wall shadow rendering is a bit heavy. Mostly in figuring out what edges to draw or not to draw
            Maybe have an array of objects, where each object represents an edge (the edge's ID is the array's index). Each object holds what the angle, length, and color of the effect is at each of the edge's vertexes
    Update Dear ImGui
    Code cleanup
        In mob FSMs, when casting a pointer to a mob and saving it in a variable, its name has three letters at the start (e.g. pik_ptr), sometimes it has one (e.g. p_ptr). It should always be three
        Some states in the Pikmin FSM don't run code on enter, and instead run that code every time the state is changed
        The code in the Pikmin FSM's functions should run functional changes first (stop moving, focus on mob, etc.), and aesthetic ones second (change animation, play sound, etc.)
        "flail_to_whistle" is really "flail_to_leader"
        Memory leaks, cppcheck, etc.
        Document every class member with a comment
        Add a getter and/or a setter for class members that shouldn't be freely edited, instead of relying on the programmer to not edit them
    Demo content
        Find a better name for the demo "game", like "Pikifen demo", instead of "Pikifen alpha"
        If something is under construction, like a menu or something, add a small "WIP" blurb
        Maybe add an F1 screen with quick-start help?
        Add more treasures
            Ball of yarn treasure
        Sounds really need a makeover...
        Mobs for decorative pebbles, stones, and sticks
        Rebalance enemies. Some are too weak, some are too strong, some are too tricky, etc. In general, they could all stand to be slightly easier, and to take longer to react to things
    Add several pre-packaged areas, since players have nothing to play with right now
        A tutorial area
            The area should be linear, but more intuitive and representative of the series
            Linear, starts with an info spot that says welcome, and mentions the movement controls
            After a bit to the right, there's a Pikmin on a ledge, and a sign telling you to whistle it
            Farther up, a sign telling you to throw the Pikmin at a Pellet Posy on a ledge
            You need to gather X Pikmin, to take down a paper bag or something
            Farther up, a sign telling you to throw Pikmin to Louie, and have him carry on
            Should end in some way to reunite the leaders, but while trying to incentivize teamwork and multitasking
            Some signs should talk about dismissing, and group moving
        A showcase area, with several corridors and rooms for the different enemies, objects, mechanics, collision tests, path tests, etc.
        Kman's Adventure area (see #content-sharing)
    Allow any animation to interpolate the transformations (rotation, scale, etc.)
    General graphic file improvements
        Leader and Pikmin portrait images should
            Be a group, and then have a mask applied on top to fit the grid rectangle
            Be resized to their final resolution of 64x64
            Have a blurred shadow to represent the chin and neck, like Winged Pikmin
        Inkscape file adjustments
            Adjust the top-left of the spritesheet to be the document's 0,0 coordinates
            Adjust the X and Y scale to be 1.00? This breaks clip masks, though; maybe render everything onto a PNG, adjust, then render again, and use a difference blend to check what's broken
            Correct the names of gradients, since some of them end in numbers due to an old Inkscape glitch
            Add a reference Olimar image in all of them
            I think I may need to export spritesheets with a row an column of dead pixels at the ends, because texture UV wraparound interpolation stuff is making artifacts from the opposite end of the spritesheet show up on the topmost and leftmost sprites
            Search for "data:image/" for leftover image files in the SVG files
            Convince it to export at 96dpi, not 90dpi
        Darker tones should use a proper good darker color, instead of just the normal color with a lower brightness component
        Using blurring and better lighting
        Add the Inkscape noise filter to more sprites? Or even a different filter
        Remember to update the Pikmin Fanon wiki page link in the PNG files
    Pikmin animation improvements
        Blinking when walking or idling -- these animations should start in random frames (do Pikmin even blink?)
        Throwing animation needs to be reworked
            Pikmin hands are below the head in the pose where the butt is facing the camera
            It's nearly impossible to tell what body part is in what angle, in a given sprite
        Pikmin lying down should be farther back than they are (at least for the Red Pikmin)
        Stems should be visible, at least the starting part
        Feet are sometimes little nubs, sometimes spiky
        Sprout animations should start with nothingness, and grow into a sprout proper (as if popping out of the ground) (Kman's made some)
            If necessary, seeds should have their own animation
        The "grabbing_near" sprite is unused for all bar Bulbmin
        More frames, for more fluidity
    Pikmin missing animations
        Sighing
        Idling (bobbing a bit so they aren't static)
        Bored (lying down, looking around, etc.)
        Flailing (also used when caught by an enemy)
        Shaking after leaving the water
        Carrying (walking while carrying)
            Note that there is currently a "grabbing" (unused) and a "carrying" animation
        Celebrating
        Crushed
        Climbing (add the track logic too)
        Sliding (add the track logic too)
        Pushing (add the group task logic too)
        Arms outstretched (add the group task logic too)
    Leader animation improvements
        More frames, for more fluidity
    Leader missing animations
        Idling (bobbing a bit so they aren't static)
        Bored
        Throwing (it exists, but isn't being used)
        Thrown (add to the logic of bouncers too)
        Climbing (add the track logic too)
        Sliding (add the track logic too)
    Misc. graphical improvements
        Improve and standardize the names of animations, sprites, and body parts
        Smoothen some of the more jerky mob animations, like Red Bulborbs flopping
        Gates should have a different appearance depending on how damaged they are
        Yellow Wollywog should close its eyes when shaking
        Candypop Buds should squash when they close
        Animate the Hocotate ship -- use Kman's zip
        Improve the explosions https://www.patreon.com/posts/explosions-part-7719254
        Add a glow to the smack effect particle?
        Spectralids shouldn't have their body dead center and only have the wings flap, their body should bob up and down aggressively like real butterflies
    Manual
        Update the area editor screenshots
        Revamp the scripting tutorial
            Currently, the reader learns how to make a "weird" Red Bulborb; they should instead be learning to create a new creature (though it could still use an included spritesheet)
            Add some help at the start about how it may be daunting to wrap your head around all of the FSM a mob will need, but the reader should focus on what states they need first and foremost, then connections, and then just script one event at a time, isolated

    Radar
        Radar page
            https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography topographic drawing, a zoom-out, an abstract texture like P1/P2, ...?
                Probably minimize the use of colors, because there can be tons of different Pikmin colors, and they should all be minimally visible
            Icons for treasures, leaders, Onions, ships, Pikmin, and whatever else of importance
            Area name, North indicator
            Go Here!
            When it is opened, it should fade in to view, as well as zoom out, to give the impression that the camera is moving up to show a larger view, from the point the leader is
            Allow it to be panned by dragging any mouse button -- people who are used to dragging with RMB on the editors will be thankful
            Working Pikmin and idle Pikmin counts
        Stats page
            Table with the amount of Pikmin of each type that is in the Onion, with you, working, idling
            Number of deaths today
            Progress towards concocting sprays
        Open it with Tab, and move leader swapping to middle mouse button
    Statistics menu, which keeps track of:
        Engine use
            Engine boot-up count, engine total play time, actual gameplay total play time
        Pikmin life
            Pikmin birth count, Pikmin death by swallowing count, Pikmin death for other reasons count, Pikmin bloom count (bud or flower; leaf to flower only counts as one), enemy kill count
        Leader control
            Pikmin throw count (not leaders), whistle use count, distance walked by the active leader (in meters), leader damage suffered count, punch damage caused, leader KO count (single leader, not full-squad wipe)
    Other menu improvements
        Onion menu
            Buttons (maybe hidden) that instantly pulls out the max number of Pikmin possible, leaves you with 20 Pikmin of that type, or leaves you with 0.
            Smoother animations and transitions
        The ability to load TTF fonts
        Should the secondary menus from the main menu also contain Pikmin formations in the background?
    Pikmin extinction
        Check Onions, ships, and converters that have Pikmin in the buffer
    Each object, spray, hazard, etc. should have a description property, that describes them in a simple way. Example for Red Pikmin: "The most basic type of Pikmin, Red Pikmin are immune to fire, and are slightly stronger than normal."
        Make the editor show the mob's description
        Also, maker, version, and comments properties
    Mission Mode stuff
        The idea is to make it so areas have some sort of goal, other than being a sandbox
        Medals
            For every stage, the player can have no medal, a bronze, a silver, or a gold
            When the end of the stage is reached, regardless of it being via "victory" or "loss", the player is graded and maybe awarded a medal
            Three grading modes:
                Points
                    The final point count depends on the following fields: Pikmin born, Pikmin deaths, time left, Pokos gathered, enemy kill points
                    Each field can have varying weights, including 0 or negative
                    Each field can also be instantly transformed to 0 if the player finished the stage via "loss"
                    You should be able to specify the starting score value, for cases where the fields only make you lose score (like a survival mission that rates you based on time SPENT, not time left)
                    Depending on the points, the player gets no medal, a bronze, a silver, a gold, or a platinum
                Completion
                    Platinum medal if the stage's goal has been reached, no medal if not. Example: puzzle stages
                None
                    No scoring whatsoever. The player always has a platinum medal on these stages, even before playing. Example: a sandbox map with no purpose
        Each stage should have the following data:
            A quick description explaining what the stage is about. Example: "These dark woods hide many dangerous beasts behind the fallen branches. Your goal is to escape without a single enemy seeing you!"
            A "tags" field, where you write tags like "Beach", "Gimmick", "Short and sweet", etc. Could be useful later on for filtering, or to match with other tagged things, like songs, if need be
            Its (subjective) difficulty
            A goal
                One of the following (partial thanks Jimble, Kman):
                    Collect treasures (specified ones or all)
                    Defeat enemies (specified ones or all)
                    Survive for the specified time
                    Reach the exit (specified leaders or all)
                    Grow the specified Pikmin amount
                    No goal
                Triggering the goal instantly finishes the level as a "victory"
            Loss conditions
                Any combination of the following:
                    Taking damage
                    Losing a Pikmin
                    Pikmin extinction (some puzzle/gimmick stages could involve no Pikmin)
                    One leader KO (as opposed to total leader KO)
                    Time limit
                        An optional override for the global day time settings -- a level could want to start at dusk and end at night, and could want to do it all over 1 real-time hour
                        Also, the number of days. For an "adventure" like experience, you could just want it to last forever over many days, or you could want it to start at sunrise and end at sunset like normal
                The following also always trigger a loss:
                    Total leader KO (nothing else to play with)
                    Quitting via the pause menu
            Scoring data
                In the case of points mode, also the score weights and the medal thresholds
            Maybe...
                A win condition for reaching X sprays of type Y
                A loss condition for killing an enemy
        Area selection menu changes

        Boss
        Add to the FAQ why there's only a normal and a fight variant -- Too many system resources
        Editor music should continue from where it left off, so that tweak-test cycles don't force the player to listen to the same 3 seconds at the beginning over and over
    Revamp sound system
        Rename sound files to .oga, instead of .ogg
        There are three types of sounds
            Sounds that play "globally", like the "task complete jingle"
            Sounds that play from any object that needs them, like there being three waterfalls in the area, and each one having the "waterfall" noise
            Sounds that play connected to only one object at a time, like the Pikmin going "hop hop" when carrying something should only be connected to the closest carriable mob to the camera center
            Or maybe there are two types of sounds, only
                The global ones, like the "task complete jingle"
                Positional global ones, like Pikmin going "hop hop" when carrying
                Positional atomic ones, like a Fiery Blowhog spitting fire
                You register a source to the sound manager. For instance, you register two "Pikmin carrying" sound sources, and have their position pointers point to the carcass X/Y. The sound manager is then responsible for checking if the camera is close to either source, and if it's close to both, at what volume to play the sound.
        Problems that the system needs to address:
            If there are two things asking to play the same sound, they should/n't cut each other off/overlay for higher volume
            If one thing is asking to stop a sound, make sure another doesn't need the sound (e.g. two carriable objects, one finishes being delivered)
            If two things are playing the same sound but in different spots of the screen, the pan should be an average or so
            If two things are playing the same sound but in different spots of the area, the volume should be an average or so
            If a sound needs to have a sudden shift in volume or pan, it should be a smooth transition
            The ability to handle randomized volumes and pitches (and maybe panning)
            If a sound needs to stop suddenly, it should fade out (very quickly)
        For sounds that are tied to a mob, the farther the mob is from the center of the screen, the quieter; panning should be relative to the mob's position with the camera, too
        Sounds shouldn't assume they're 44100Hz
        A way to fade sounds in/out
        Load system sounds from System_asset_file_names.txt
        When cutting off a sound (like stopping the whistle), make it do a very quick fade out instead. This stops the sound from crackling.
        Sounds should pause when you pause the game
        Make it so that only 6 or so sounds can play at once?
        Options
            Volume control for sound effects, music, and ambiance sound effects separately
                The standard should be at 75%, so players have leeway if they want everything louder
            Mono/stereo
        Footsteps should be tied to the terrain texture
        It should be possible to play sounds both in specific frames of animation and in scripts as actions
        Some sounds should be able to start a random of amount of time after they're supposed to. This helps everything feel organic instead of robotic and calculated.
        Missing sounds
            Pikmin seed landing
            Pikmin sprout evolving/reverting
        Recreate the following sounds, as per user feedback

    Check what Pikmin 3 Deluxe added, and gather ideas of things to implement from there
    Input handling needs to be more robust and modular
        Clean up terms -- button, input, action, are all ambiguous and mean different things in different functions
        An Allegro event is turned into a abstract action report and pre-processed (some actions only want 0/1, others want it raw), and only then sent
        Each action should be able to specify if it allows button-downs without button-ups (for Pikmin, holding A to whistle, and then pressing B shouldn't restart the whistle, but in Rhtyhm Heaven, holding A to do a hit, and then pressing B should be another hit)
        Be careful with camera zoom in/out!
        When the window focus is lost, the controls should be "released"
        Make input_manager as atomic as possible
        Allow for button combinations
        Would it make sense to have a screen stack system, with push&pop?
        Try to make it deterministic enough to support input playback (replays)?
        Should the option name + string representation be in input_manager or outside?
        Rework the controls menu to be more intuitive
            Maybe a list of saved control schemes, like the list of saved rulesets in Smash Ultimate? It could come pre-packaged with Keyboard+Mouse, JoyCon, etc. Careful with generic controllers though, since their buttons are as good as random. Also, if there are four players, and they all want JoyCons, there should be a way for them to choose which is which
            Maybe a "simple" controls menu and an "advanced" one? The advanced is the old one, but the "simple" one lets the player choose a controller, only map the most common controls, and automatically associate an analog stick to all four directions. If I do this, I should add a tip to the readme to tell people to try the advanced controls after they're comfortable with the engine.
            When waiting for an input to assign, only detect a joystick tilt if it is above a certain threshold, otherwise even the gentlest breeze will make it assign a random joystick axis
            Save the controls in the options file inside a block, and possibly at the end of the options file
        Current leader should move slower if the analog stick is not held all the way
        If you're holding a direction as you read a sign, you'll continue to go in that direction, even if you let go. Pressing again fixes this. Make sure this is fixed.
        There should be a cap on how many Pikmin can be thrown per second -- if the player presses the button while in cooldown, it should probably queue the throw -- the same needs to be done for other buttons, probably
        Button icons should use smaller text, and be less verbose, for things like axes
        If you're whistling, pause the game, release the whistle, and unpause, the game will probably not detect the release -- do something about it
        When the window loses focus, it should reset the inputs, so that if you were holding a direction when the game lost focus, you won't have your leader keep walking (thanks Ambrosia)
        New approach, thought of long after I've paused this project:
            One layer transforms hardware inputs into clean inputs, like mouse down, joystick axis positive (after joystick sanitization), etc.
            Another layer transforms those inputs into actions, and it knows that some actions only want 0/1, others want the raw value, etc.
            The final layer performs stuff in game based on the actions - a queue. This is important because the queue may want to delay actions. For instance, every item in the queue has a TTL. If the next item in the queue is a punch, and the game can't handle the punch, it can delay the event, and knock its TTL down. If in a later frame, it can be handled, good, but if not, it times out and dies. This makes it so the player can press LMB to punch while in the middle of a punch, and then let the input get processed whenever possible (within the TTL)
            One of these layers has to take care about not letting a LMB1-down event come after another LMB1-down event without an LMB1-up event...
            Idea: the action manager has a list of all actions and their states (float from 0 to 1), as well as the state the previous frame, so the engine can check if a whistle was released, for example (1 last frame, 0 now) -- probably have different systems in place for the global game input and the gameplay game input? Like, have a different system for checking inputs outside of menus, so that if B is held during the menu it is considered as pressed the very first frame the menu is gone
            Instead of letting the game layer have to worry about normalizing joysticks, let the hardware layer do so
    There should be a Notification struct which holds data about the current on-screen notification (e.g. Click to pluck)
        There should only be one on-screen at a time
        Every frame, you tell the notification what to show, or nothing at all (multiple messages are also allowed), and then tick it. The struct keeps track of what it was showing. If it was showing nothing, and now it was told to show something, smoothly make the notification grow and show up from alpha 0.
        The same notification could show "(LMB) Pluck", "(1) Pluck", "[X] Pluck", etc.
    Normal hitboxes should specify what happens when a thrown Pikmin touches it -- latches, bounces off, or ignores (right now, all non-latchers are bouncers, so throwing a Pikmin while on top of a fire geyser results in the Pikmin bouncing back)
    Enemy revival
    A way to start a timer after a random amount of time, based on the coordinates; this allows stuff like a group of fire geysers to start spitting fire at different times
    The ability for Blue Pikmin to rescue drowning Pikmin
    Pause menu should include the options
    Floors-over-floors; mostly for bridges
        Revamp physics
            The logic is the same as the old logic, except replace sectors with floors
            Can I add slopes?
            To figure out what floors to use:
                If the mob is touching the FOF, the FOF's Z
                Else, the normal floor Z
            If the sector a mob is going into has a FOF, the FOF can be unaccounted for at collision check time, but then the mob may end up inside of it after it enters the sector, and needs to do a step up
        To draw their shadows
            4 pixels of purely black alpha 80%, then 8 pixels of gradient to alpha 0
        Bridge railings
            Make the railings be created automatically, based on the height of nearby bridge sectors
            Make them 1 unit higher than the bridge floor
            Make it so it's impossible to step if the sector you're on is of the bridge type, and the sector you're stepping into is of the railing type
        Edge cases:
            FOF stairways need to work well
            Can a mob go from sector A's main floor (0), to sector B's main floor (50), to sector A's FOF (100), to sector B's FOF (150)? SHOULD it?
        Precautions:
            FOFs in dark sectors should be dark
            Make sure users can create a FOF that's 0 units above the main floor, for decoration purposes, and that this does not have an impact on collisions and whatnot
        Misc
            Does it make sense to create a FOF above a bottomless pit?
            https://www.deviantart.com/ronindude/art/Battlemap-Beach-Cave-730069774 I like the style of this -- maybe it can help with readability?
    Multiplayer
        1 struct of info for each player, multiplayer controls
        During loading, show how the screen is going to be split, and show which player is in which screen
        Pauses are full-screen, pause everything, and every player should get their pause menu button, so that if one player is busy mashing, they don't start picking options because somebody else paused
        Split-screen logic: vertical, horizontal, and four-way
            Add HUD support for all the different layouts
        Make sure that:
            Leaders can't steal each other's group members
                This includes Pikmin that are knocked down and get whistled
            Logic like culling isn't relying on just the first player
            Make sure Pikmin can't carry something the opposing team is already carrying
            Candypop Buds can't accept Pikmin from another team
        Figure out how the game is meant to work when:
            A pause happens -- when an Onion menu is entered, radar is opened, game pause is activated. Show the menu in full-screen or just the player's menu? Pause the game for that player, all, or none?
            A player's leader needs to throw another's
        Change menus to let you pick how many and which players will play
        Rules and game modes
            Point capture
                When a Pikmin is on top of a point, it slowly captures for that team, a la TF2. The more Pikmin, the quicker it captures
            Build a Wonder
                Like in Age of Empires, you can gather materials into a spot, and once you have enough, you can start building a Wonder. If you manage to build it, you win automatically
            Tag
                One player's leader is "it", and hitting another's leader (via Pikmin or punch) causes them to be "it". When a player becomes "it", all Pikmin in the area go under their control, and theirs only. "It" players can leave Pikmin in chokepoints, use pincer maneuvers, juggle between growing more Pikmin, or keeping a low army to make life worse for the next "it". Runaway leaders can't do much other than run and punch each other, or wildlife. Every player has a timer that ticks up when they are "it", and the first to reach 3 minutes or so loses.
        A way for attack hitboxes to cause no knockback, otherwise Pikmin battles will keep knocking the Pikmin down
            Maybe add three types of knockback: none, flinch (makes leaders reel back in pain and Pikmin fall over), and chuck
        Competitive Mission Mode? Pikmin can't attack each other, and the player with the highest score at the end of the mission wins. Probably requires symmetrical maps, or all players starting in the same spot
        If there is bingo, then there should be an option to allow simultaneous bingo patterns to score multiple points. Like if the final thing you collect scores 3 lines at once, you up 3 points in the overall standing. (thanks Nieton)
    Buried treasure
    Breadbugs should carry treasure
    Weather improvements
        Maybe call it ambiance?
        All parameters (wind, blackout, precipitation, etc.) should be configurable in a single minutes table
        Make it possible to have a weighted random distribution table for what other weather conditions it can change to as time goes by.
            Example: 80% clear, 20% overcast, set to pick every hour. It could make it so it's clear at 3PM and 4PM, but starts getting overcast between 4 and 5, and uses the overcast weather at 5PM
        Wind
        Precipitation
            Only on sectors that have full brightness, which are presumed to be outside -- make this a setting, though
                If this is too processor-intensive, then have caves and insides be controlled by area scenes, like how Pikmin 3 splits into scenes
            https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66f6bI2uIdQ
            https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/164361/2d-blizzard-snowstorm-effect
            Idea:
                Since I can't draw all particles of precipitation that are in the entire area at once, and since the devs need to be able to control the density, the area is separated into an imaginary grid, much like how the blockmaps work.
                Any given grid cell can only have one particle (though if something like a leaf flutters about randomly, it can leave its grid cell).
                All particles spawn in waves, though for variety, all cells have a fixed delay, ranging from 0 seconds to the wave duration.
                    A cell's random delay can be obtained by hashing its X/Y coordinates.
                The X/Y coordinates of where a particle spawns inside a cell are random every wave.
                    These are obtained by hashing the X/Y coordinates and the current wave number.
            Snow, wind, leaves, embers
        Thunder flashes
            Maybe have an option to make the flash much weaker, because of seizures?
        Types of blackout
            Only the leaders, only leaders + Pikmin, everything but leaders + Pikmin, etc.
            Specific enemies that don't cast light, so you can have Phosbats
        Mist
            See if that clashes with fog, or if it can be its own thing
        Floating particles found in caves -- or should this count as something different from weather? Maybe it'd work better as an object that spawns them
        Position of the sun, and position of the moon?
        Set the entire area to a hazard during a part of the day (e.g. rain that drowns non-Blue Pikmin)
        Set the direction of the sun -- indoor lighting likely uses a fixed light direction
        A way to control what parts of the area use what weather -- that way, a cave can use a blackout, or stay out of rain
        You should be able to tint water -- for instance, at sunset, making the water look a bit more pink
        A way to specify an ambiance sound effect that loops
    Replay
        A vector of "abstract" objects
            A parameter with info if they're an obstacle, Pikmin, leader, enemy, or treasure (reflects how they're drawn)
            An array of their X/Y over time; saves once a second or so
            A parameter for their time of death and time of creation
        A vector that contains when a leader change occurred, and to what leader
        When playing back the replay, interpolate the position of the mob between the last key-moment and the next
        Save into a binary file so it can be shared with other players
        Make replays save whenever there's a crash dump
    Caves
        Cave units
        Some randomization algorithm...
    Story mode stuff
        Persistent progress saving
            Write somewhere that the save was successful, and warn about save errors
            At the start of a new day, open bridges, dead enemies, etc. should go to the final states instantly
            The save file should contain a checksum for the save file proper, and one for the game files/folder
        Cutscenes http://www.pikminwiki.com/Cutscenes
            Make all cutscenes skippable
            Either make everything freeze during cutscenes, except for the actors that are part of it, or make everything continue, but health values be frozen (this way, leaders and Pikmin won't get hurt while the player can't react)
            A cutscene queue, in case multiple ones need to start at once
            Scripting for them
                Among other things, a way to move the camera, both with teleport, and smoothly
                Maybe it should use the exact same logic as regular mob scripting. Obviously mob actions won't work, but changing states, ticking events, and performing actions onto mobs works
                    Perhaps an action to start controlling a given mob from here on, so that actions apply to that mob only. To make sure there are no leaks, each "start_controlling_mob" action must have an equivalent closing "end_controlling_mob" within the same event.
        Sprouts between areas, days, etc.
            Don't forget that sprouts should turn into flowers overnight
        Enemies respawning after some days
        Area unlocking
        Pause menu
            When "end day" is chosen, it should warn about idle Pikmin that will get left behind
            The "quit" option should take you to day selection
        Radar menu stats page
            The total play time should be shown somewhere; useful for speedruns
            Pikmin born so far, Pikmin deaths so far
            Total Pokos (or whatever point systems exist) collected
        Pellet Posies, Candypop Buds, etc. should only cycle between the colors available
        The ability for dead flower Pikmin to leave a sprout for the next day. The game settings can specify the change of a dead flower leaving it behind (including 0% to disable the feature)
        Sunset
            On-screen warning
            Draw down the safe radius around all Onions
            Wild Pikmin and sprouts should be immune to the sunset
        Catalogs
            There can be multiple catalogs -- Piklopedia and Treasure Hoard are two different catalogs
            A file, likely Game_data/Misc/Catalogs.txt is responsible for:
                Which catalogs exist, as well as their icons, unlock criteria, etc.
                What entries exist in each, in order
                What logs each entry contains (Olimar's notes, Louie's notes, Sales pitch, etc.)
                How each entry is unlocked (touching it, seeing it, killing it, recovering it to an Onion/ship, etc.)
        Collectibles (ship parts, treasures, etc.) and how they impact the story
            Allow multiple "point systems" -- ship power, juice, fruits, Pokos, etc.
        Upgrades (like the Exploration Kit)
        Extinction
            Be careful with Candypop Buds
            Cave extinction should probably be named something else, since the Pikmin species aren't necessarily extinct...
        Day limit
            A "casual mode" option where you can disable the day limit, if the game allows that?
        Today's Report
            One long page filled with everything, that the player can scroll up and down -- this way there aren't several pages the player has to mash through, and it's scalable with any number of Pikmin types, content, etc.
                Population chart over the day, with icons for key events
                Deaths by type, both today and so far
                Total number of Pikmin left in the Onion
                What objective items were collected today
                Total of the objective collected, and total remaining
                The player can press a button somewhere to watch a replay, or click to continue
        Final stats
            Completion time, in seconds
        Misc.
            The ability for some Candypop Buds to not spawn if the player has over X Pikmin of that type in total
    More editors
        Weather editor
        Particle editor
        Script editor
    Probably more...?
    
    
Small tasks (for when I'm feeling lazy)
    Style
        Document the code with comments
    Cleanup
        Remove magic numbers and magic strings (make numbers and strings into constants)
    
    
Misc things (so I don't forget)
    Loose thoughts
        With the current Pikmin "missed hitbox" register, it's possible that an enemy will want to attack with the same hitbox multiple times in the same animation, but all those times will be ignored for 1.5 seconds (think the Man-at-Legs's shots)
        Maybe make it so that when a mob touches a hitbox, it sets a flag, and if the next frame it also touches a hitbox, ignore the event; repeat until there is a frame where the hitbox hasn't been touched -- this could stop the mob from getting hit multiple times by the same hitbox
    Aesthetic
        More juice
            Sun Meter should grow on checkpoints
            HUD number of Pikmin on the field/army/etc. should grow when they change
            HUD should come in/out of frame when pause is used
            Find more ideas from the canon games
        When a spray is about to run out, make the mobs flash
        Obstacles should have a different health meter, so it doesn't look like health, but rather completion progress
        A property for mob types to control whether the health is always visible, or disappears after X seconds, only to reappear when the cursor goes over them
        Earthquake effect
            See https://www.pikminwiki.com/Rumble
            If the earthquake emitter is at the center of the screen, full intensity. The farther it is, the weaker the intensity. I think 2x offscreen or more should be 0 intensity.

                Have a "trauma" variable (0-1) that goes up (something like 0.4) every time a shake happens, and goes down over time
                When shaking the screen, the multiplier of the amount to shake should be trauma^2 or trauma^3 so it's smooth
                Don't offset the camera negatively, but use something like offsetX = maxOffset * shake_mult * GetPerlinNoise(seed, time);  offsetY = maxOffset * shake_mult * GetPerlinNoise(seed + 1, time);
                    Or instead of PerlinNoise, use simple value noise http://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/procedural-generation-virtual-worlds/procedural-patterns-noise-part-1/creating-simple-1D-noise
        Dust particles while walking
        A spray of whistle particles for when there's a dismiss, and whistle particle "smoke" when group moving
        Camera should mostly center on the leader, but offset slightly towards where the group is, offsetting more the more the group is farther away, maybe also pointing a bit to where the leader is headed, etc.
        Make the mob sprite scale when hurt, like an elastic
        Mobs shrinking or increasing in size because of their height should be limited -- fall too much and your dimensions turn negative
        Add a way for a GUI element's drawing routine to receive alpha as a parameter? And then each element should be responsible for drawing with that alpha. Could be useful for fade ins and fade outs
    An option for the cursor to snap to the nearest object in-game, with an adjustable radius
    "a suggestion, when using pushes_with_hitboxes it should use the hitbox's height rather than the object's height" (thanks Kman)
    A Pikmin that's on fire and runs to the water should probably drown instead of continuing to be on fire
    Water isn't fading with darkness if you have fader textures https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/347158607734767636/449334153763356672/Pikifen_alpha_5_24_2018_6_12_41_PM.png https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/459094782648778772/491739297548992513/unknown.png
    Carrying stuff
        A traffic system? Here's my idea:
            Each stop link can hold a capacity number. The maximum value is the length of the link. Whenever a mob is taking this link, the mob's diameter (plus some padding?) is added to the value, and when a mob is no longer taking it, it is removed. When a mob that is carrying something is trying to enter a full link, it will stand in place instead of proceeding.
            Be careful for Pikmin carrying things in opposite directions. Maybe have a tie-breaker in some way?
        When there are multiple Onions or ships that something can be delivered to, choose the closest
        Smoother turns when carrying
        If a Red Pikmin is carrying a 1 pellet, and a Yellow joined, shouldn't the destination be Red, and not randomized?
        When deciding a new random Onion to go to, pick cyclically -- first go with Red (if applicable), then if the player does it again, go Yellow (if applicable), etc. (GitHub issue #8)
        Make it so you can line the Pikmin in a non-circular fashion -- Neo suggested a parameter to stretch the circle vertically or horizontally
        Stops could probably have a radius, to reduce the number of stops needed in a room, for instance
    More powerful scripting
        Object types should have a list of tags. Then, via scripting, you can ask if a mob has a specific tag or not. The tags can be anything, like "flammable", "can_be_alerted", etc.
        A way to run actions on other mobs
            You can pick a mob's focused mob, you can pick a mob from the entire area that matches a certain filter of type/category/variable value, you can pick the mob's parent mob, etc.
        Global script variables

    Water depth (thanks ThyCheshireCat)
        Either way, consider giving water surfaces their own Z. Not just for drawing, but for the purposes of considering something submerged, too
    "I think carry weight should be displayed when you hover over an enemy corpse/pellet" (thanks Tenacious)
    The scale category doesn't really need to exist -- the code that gets the current weight could be something any mob could use, and a way to display a custom number atop the mob could be added to the script (thanks Kman)
    Enemies could have individual territories -- a circle that can be anywhere (detached from the mob) and have any radius, and the mob has to be confined to that
    Look into the "Next maturity" controls -- does the way they work make sense? Why can't you switch without holding a Pikmin?
    A way for a Pikmin type to control what its resistance to being shaken off is
    I think I found a way to do addictive blending right -- for instance, to draw a mob green, first you draw it multiplied by green (0, 255, 0, 255), then you draw an addictive sprite on top with 0, 255, 0, 128 -- seems to work well on GIMP
    Objects falling from the sky
        When a leader approaches, when a Pikmin approaches, when carrying, etc.

    Add the feature that makes dead flower Pikmin sometimes drop a sprout, before the story mode is done? It could spawn a sprout for use later in the day
    Option to pause the game if the window is not focused
    The spray effect that buries Pikmin should probably only affect opponent Pikmin
    on_carrying_lift and on_carrying_drop events?
    A checkbox for the attack hitboxes that make it so the knockback simply pushes without actually making the Pikmin/leader fall over (thanks Kman)
    A way to add random variation to the knockback angle of a hitbox
    If a Pikmin type has black as the color, the idle glow needs to... not be black
    Seeds should take time to transform into sprouts -- this encourages the player to multitask instead of waiting for loot to be delivered to the Onion
    The area editor should have a "toolbar" so you can swap from layout to mob to path real quick, instead of having to quit out. Also, shortcut keys for that in F1, F2, etc.
    Pressing Esc on the sprite/whatever rename pop-up should cancel
        Calling ImGui::CloseCurrentPopup(); doesn't seem to work...
    Area sections
        Large rectangles that are imposed on the area to specify certain things
        Ideas of sections
            Radar limits -- any sector beyond this rectangle does not show up on the radar. Alternatively, any sector INSIDE the rectangle doesn't show up
            Indoors/Outdoors -- used to control if precipitation can fall in here
    When a Pikmin is being burnt up or poisoned, etc., have a few frames at the start of it where it CAN'T be whistled to be saved. This prevents the player from whistling in the area of a soon-to-be burned Pikmin, and save the Pikmin instantly
    Area background improvements
        Support for backgrounds that don't tile -- what if you want a background that's a tree trunk, because you're on branches? It shouldn't tile, nor should the maker be forced to use a workaround where they have thousands of pixels of blank space for padding
        Add background viewing/editing to the area editor
        Foreground
    If there are no Onions, Pikmin should bring corpses to the ship
    If your Pikmin are far away and you dismiss them, they should just create groups where they are, not next to where you ordered the dismiss...right?
    If a Pikmin is too far away, it should sigh and lose the party
    "Oh, yeah, quick suggestion, make all of the pikmin that a leader has get disbanded and maybe panic around for a bit when the leader dies" (thanks Neo)
    Pikmin movement and other actions should have random offsets and delays of tiny amounts, just so that the army feels like a group of individuals, instead of several robots
    New actions
        Logic for an arachnorb to turn to/chase the focused mob? (thanks Neo)
        Logic for arachnorbs to move freely, instead of only forward? (thanks Neo)
    If Pikmin are killed (off-screen, on-screen, or both?), the counters should have some feedback -- this also helps audibly impaired players who can't hear the Pikmin squeals
    Calculate the entirety of the scene's lighting in a lightmap, that gets overlaid in the end
        Apply fog, blackout, sector darkness, etc. on this
        Check if this would have a large performance impact
        This would allow mobs to cast light, which would just lighten up that zone of the lightmap
    Demo game content to add
        Enemies
            Scuttlebug?
            A completely original enemy
        Cyan Pikmin and Green Pikmin?
    Particle improvements
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIjrSvGddDQ
        Particles should have a secondary way of dying - shrinking instead of exclusively fading to transparent
        Color gradients, or interpolation, or some way to get smoke from red to yellow to grey
        The size, color, etc. parameters should be split into "start", "half", and "end" of life
        Each generator in its own data file? It'd make it easier to share them
        Additive blending and normal blending
        Spawning some distance beyond the center -- good to get the smoke from the BLL's stomp to start near the edges of the feet, not the center
    HUD element for a digital clock?
    Maker tools
        A maker tool that just lists how many particles are active, how many mobs, bitmaps loaded, etc.
        Maker tools should be bound to buttons in the same way the regular controls are, instead of being stuck in the number and F keys
    Specific, niche tools for editors?
        For the animation editor: reverse frames
    Switch angles to vectors?
    In multiplayer modes, if players in different teams throw Pikmin into the same Candypop Bud at the same time, that might cause problems
    In challenge levels, the engine should probably keep track of how many tries the player had
    Game config parameters:
        Nectars: Work like in the engine, or like in the classics?
    Should I auto-fade textures on stepping height?
    A redo button in the area editor
    Story mode
        Some treasures should weigh as much as the current army, after a boss battle
    Final menu tree
        Play
            Story Mode
            Mission Mode
            Multiplayer Battle
            Freeplay (pick an area, regardless of game mode, and just mess around in a sandbox with no rules)
        Make
            Areas
            Animations
            ...
        Options
            ...
        Quit
    
    
Tasks for later on (I might never implement these)
    Known problems
        On my other laptop, screenshots come out with alpha
        Kman found a crash on the area editor -- area with invalid shadow, restart engine, area editor, find problems, go to problem -> crash -- I can't reproduce, but it must have something to do with pointers not being cleared
    ...An AI opponent in 2-player mode? It would help me test...
    Colors should be able to also be in hexadecimal?
    The ability for enemies to eat other enemies
    If I need GPU performance gains, resize textures to smaller sizes when they're loaded (thanks Kman)
    A way for spike damage to apply a status effect
    A way to write out how much memory is being taken up by images, sounds, scripts, etc. so game makers can help make sure a level's not too bloated?
    Nighttime (what enemies can spawn at night, their changes, etc.)
        Change the HUD icon to a moon
    "Puzzle"-type challenges. You might have a limited number of Pikmin, certain obstacles and paths, and you need to think what Pikmin to put where and when to proceed. Like Portal.
        Door objects
        Button objects (with a certain number of Pikmin needed to keep it depressed)
        Marks on the floor -- Red Pikmin carry things to the red mark, Yellows to the yellow mark, etc.
    If feasible, make it so that every enemy checks if there are Pikmin around it (check one out of every two Pikmin), this check shouldn't be distance based, but dx and dy based. If there is any Pikmin or leader nearby, or it's on-camera, then fully work the mob as normal. Otherwise, don't do anything to the mob.
        Maybe keep a timer that goes back to ~2 seconds every time a Pikmin/leader nearby is detected, and until it reaches 0, do not check for loneliness.
    Random enemy spawning
    Breath of the Wild-like physics engine rules? https://venturebeat.com/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-makes-chemistry-just-as-important-as-physics/
        And just systemic gameplay in general, like lit Pikmin lighting nearby Pikmin on fire http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnpAAX9CkIc
            Red Pikmin can carry flaming coals, which can set enemies on fire
    Enemies don't care about bottomless pits and will gladly walk off when roaming -- is there any way to remedy this? Should I?
    Hiding
    If you write an event name wrong (or other things), give suggestions ("did you mean X?")
    Warp point, like in Pikmin 3
        Carrying paths should be able to specify a "portal" link, which internally is considered to be 0-distance. This helps calculate the destinations without considering two warp points as being insanely far apart
    A colorblind-friendly mode?
    A "peaceful" mode where Pikmin and leaders can't die
    Petrified enemies should break open when defeated
        Maybe define loot tables somewhere, like "standard", "boss", "weakling", etc. Enemy types use the "standard" one by default (which one is the default should be specified somewhere), but can choose a different one
            Maybe individual enemy instances in an area can also specify their own loot table?
    Editors
        Area editor
            Instead of a single-click selecting a sector, make it a double-click? This way you can still create a selection rectangle when you're inside the sector
            A tool that checks every point in the map (more like every 2 units) and checks if the closest carrying point is on the other side of a wall or something
            The area editor could have a button to start testing from where the cursor is, a la Mario Maker. Also, to spawn some Pikmin with, maybe
            When deleting a mob link, flash the link red when you mouse-over. Similarly, flash a potential linkable object yellow when you mouse-over it. Think of doing the same for other similar operations
            Backups
                When an area is saved, delete the backup. When an area is loaded, if a backup is found, ask if they want to restore that backup instead.
                If it detects an auto-backup that's younger than the saved area, it should ask the user if they want to continue from the backup
            The ability to add comments to an area; they should show up as like a question mark, and when you click it, you see/edit the comment in the panel
            A way to set the opacity of mobs in layout mode; possibly others of the sort (thanks Kman)
            A feature with which to search for mobs/sectors
            Buttons to align textures with the sectors, stretching them to fit, or to tile twice, three times, left-aligned, right-aligned, etc.
            The problem searcher could detect when an enemy's spoils is set to an object that doesn't exist (thanks Nutty171)
        Animation editor
            "Sprite" -> "Pose"?
            You start by being presented with the spritesheet, then you click on a sprite, write its name, click on the next, its name, etc.
                Or you just draw a line or something above all sprites you want, and it auto-creates some sprites (thanks Tenacious)
            Add a section to find errors
                It could check what kind of animation this is, like a Pikmin type, and determine that there are some needed animations that are not included
                Maybe report if an enemy has attack hitboxes that don't hit below it?
        Both editors
            Put the canvas in one ImGui window and the panel in another?
            A tutorial built into each editor?
            Hold Ctrl while dragging to lock to an axis?
            For buttons that change the state of something (e.g. toggle reference image on/off, change current snapping mode), I need to figure out what to do...
                a) Have the icon represent the current mode?
                b) Have the icon represent the next mode?
                c) Only use buttons for one-off actions, and use checkboxes or something else for these mode-changing widgets
    Blood (optional, of course)
    Some way to let users organize their mob types into sub-folders, and have that reflect in the area editor
    Enemies should have a cloud of breath in cold areas (GitHub issue #10)
    Resolution
        Players should be able to resize the window on-the-fly (GitHub issue #2)
        Resizing the window should stretch the resolution instead of showing more of the world (GitHub issue #7)
    Aesthetic details
        Different "switched to Pikmin" sound for when you switch to a held leader instead of a Pikmin
        When writing a character dialog message on the bottom of the screen, make the letters have some effect, to pop in and move out
        HUD elements that aren't needed right now should be super-transparent. For example, in Metroid Prime, when there is no hazard danger, the meter on the right is barely visible, but is still there
        Make the main menu's highlighter move from one place to another gradually, based on how far it is (like the camera moves in-game)
        The music should change to swing for Louie
        Particles
            Splash particles for going in water
            Particles should have a "emits light?" property
            Particles floating in the wind
            A background detail: those little floaty white things you see in forests
        Beams of light shining between the leaves; they should spin with the sun, and sometimes fade out to non-existence
        Shadows of leaves should shift along the day, and become less opaque at the start and end
        Clovers, Margarets, etc. rustling should also maybe move north and south a bit, so that it's a bit of a circular motion (ellipse, really)
        Cloud shadows? When a cloud is casting a shadow, tree shadows shouldn't exist
        Water should reflect clouds and the sun... and maybe other things like an aurora borealis?
            https://www.reddit.com/r/aestheticrain/comments/7m61zy/blossom_on_a_pond_1080p/
            See the Pikmin 2 ending movie, for instance
        Water should be shown in the area editor's review mode
        Maybe decorative objects should have a script variable that determines whether or not they rotate; useful if you want to place some decorative objects with manual rotation for level design purposes (thanks Nutty171)
    A competitive mode where each team's marble is out in the open, but you can throw Pikmin at piles of twigs, shards of iron, etc. found in the area. They carry it (like bomb rocks), and when thrown in the room where the marble is, they start working with the materials they have and build a solid block there. Creating complex mazes and traps with the blocks is what stops the enemy team from gathering the marble so easily.
    Story mode
        A way to choose what landing site of the area you want to start the day in
    Barely important format changes
        Status effects shouldn't have several "affects" properties, but just one, that takes a semicolon-separated list
        In area geometry files, path stops use the term "nr" to refer to links, even though they contain more than the end stop number
        Bud_icon.png and Flower_icon.png should be White_bud_icon.png and White_flower_icon.png, to fit with the pink and purple buds and flowers
    Online play?
        It'd likely use deterministic lockstep https://gafferongames.com/post/deterministic_lockstep/
        Should it send the events, or "controller" state? If the former, be careful with the player mashing the keyboard and sending many events in one frame. If the latter, there'll be a lot of duplicated info
    Possible cleanup
        Timers
            Have a timer manager, so I don't have to remember to do a .tick() to every single one
                Remember that the fade manager can unload the current game state!
            Create auto-eased timers? Like, they return a number from 0 to 1, and can use several methods, like 0->1 in the first half and then 1->0, or eased in, or...
            A flag that specifies whether it auto-starts on creation, whether it auto-rearms after reaching 0, etc.
            Thoughts:
                Actually, the only advantage of this is the auto-ticking... But it might introduce a performance penalty, having to add and remove hundreds of timers in a vector

    Stuff that isn't really justifiable yet, but may be one day
        Should the leader's throw preview indicate collisions against mobs? It's not really necessary, and there are all sorts of weird cases, like decorative vs. combat mobs, untouchable hitboxes, etc.
        The ability for status effects to add/remove HP in absolute amounts, not relative
        Suggestions
            Add an option for statuses to make the leader helpless until the player presses right-click or something (thanks Neo)
            An action with which to change a mob's home
            A way to change a mob's speed, rotation speed, etc., via scripting, instead of it being tied to the mob type's speed
                You can just give the mob a status effect that changes its speed
    Possible solutions to known issues
        Remove all native message boxes, and implement my own, or come up with alternative ways to supply the information. If I could remove all of them, there would be no more problems with "true fullscreen" mode
    Specific requested features
        An enemy that can heal, for instance, 20HP for each Pikmin eaten
        An attribute for Pikmin types that makes it possible to throw them farther/closer than standard
    Questions to be answered later
        Change the logic of Pikmin chasing after opponents (pikmin_fsm::go_to_opponent, pikmin_fsm::rechase_opponent) to better suit rectangular objects?
        If P1's leader throws a mine at P2's leader, and it sticks on them, that leader will be *holding* the mine. This will probably break a lot of logic that assumes holding just refers to the pre-throw Pikmin hold
        Do Pikmin need to have a delay before their health regeneration kicks in?
