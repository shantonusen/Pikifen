    <p>The <b>Pikmin</b> are the creatures the player's leader commands. They can carry, fight, multiply, get eaten, etc.</p>

    <p>Examples of Pikmin include Red Pikmin, Yellow Pikmin, Purple Pikmin, etc.</p>

    <p>To create a new type of Pikmin, please follow the <a href="mob_type.html">making object types tutorial</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    
    <p>The Pikmin are programmed to do a lot of things in the engine, and the player can edit several of their properties to create Pikmin resistant to various things, and with different strengths and weaknesses.</p>

    <p>Pikmin type objects are hardcoded in the engine to be shot out as a seed from an Onion, be a sprout on the floor, get plucked by a leader, follow a leader in a formation, be thrown, get dismissed, idle, chase an opponent, sigh when giving up on something, carry something, return to a pile of carriable objects, attacking while on the floor or latched on, be grabbed by an enemy, get knocked down, become paralyzed, flail around, panic around, drink a drop, and carry a tool. Pretty much all of the Pikmin's behavior comes from what is in the engine's code, and is too complex to do via scripting, so Pikmin do not support user-made scripting.</p>

    <p>If you're creating a new Pikmin type, you may want to add it to the correct spot in the <a href="misc_config.html">game configuration</a>'s Pikmin order.</p>

    <h2 id="props">Properties</h2>
    
    <p>Besides the <a href="mob_type.html#creating">global object type properties</a>, a Pikmin type has the following properties.</p>

    <p>Note that if you want your Pikmin to be resistant to a certain hazard, you'll want to use the <a href="mob_type.html#vulnerabilities">vulnerabilities</a> properties. Another thing to note when making Pikmin is that the movement speed property indicates the movement speed of a leaf Pikmin. Bud Pikmin move 110% faster, and flowers move 120% faster.</p>

    <h3 id="mandatory">Mandatory</h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li><b><code>icon_leaf</code></b>: Name of the image with the Pikmin type's icon for when it is a leaf. This is displayed on the HUD, for the standby Pikmin bubble. The image should be in <code>Game_data/Graphics</code>, and the extension of the file name must be included.</li>
      <li><b><code>icon_bud</code></b>: Same as <code>icon_leaf</code>, but for a bud.</li>
      <li><b><code>icon_flower</code></b>: Same as <code>icon_leaf</code>, but for a flower.</li>
      <li><b><code>top_leaf</code></b>: Name of the image with the leaf sprite to use in-game. The image should be in <code>Game_data/Graphics</code>, and the extension of the file name must be included.</li>
      <li><b><code>top_bud</code></b>: Same as <code>top_leaf</code>, but for a bud.</li>
      <li><b><code>top_flower</code></b>: Same as <code>top_leaf</code>, but for a flower.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>None.</p>

    <h3 id="optional">Optional</h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li><b><code>attack_method</code></b>: Determines how the Pikmin attacks other objects. Defaults to <code>latch</code>. Possible values are:
        <ul>
          <li><code>latch</code> to make the Pikmin latch on when thrown or when grounded next to the object.</li>
          <li><code>impact</code> to make the Pikmin cause impact damage, bounce back when thrown, lie down for a while after hitting, and also lunge on their own when grounded next to the object.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b><code>can_carry_tools</code></b>: <code>true</code> if the Pikmin can carry tools. Defaults to <code>true</code>.</li>
      <li><b><code>can_fly</code></b>: <code>true</code> if the Pikmin can move vertically to get to its destination. It also makes the Pikmin idle some units above floor level, and be above a leader when chasing them. Defaults to <code>false</code>.</li>
      <li><b><code>carry_strength</code></b>: The Pikmin is worth this much for carrying strength. Defaults to 1.</li>
      <li><b><code>push_strength</code></b>: The Pikmin is worth this much for pushing strength. Used for certain <a href="mob_group_task.html">group tasks</a>. Defaults to 1.</li>
      <li><b><code>max_throw_height</code></b>: When thrown, the Pikmin reaches this height at the apex of the throw. For reference, a standard Pikmin has this set to 260, and Yellow Pikmin have this set to 330. Defaults to 260.</li>
      <li><b><code>sprout_evolution_time_1</code></b>: How long a leaf Pikmin sprout must wait before they turn into a bud. 0 means it will never evolve into the next stage. Defaults to 2 minutes.</li>
      <li><b><code>sprout_evolution_time_2</code></b>: Same as the previous, but between a bud and a flower. Defaults to 2 minutes.</li>
      <li><b><code>sprout_evolution_time_3</code></b>: Same as the previous, but between a flower and the process of withering back into a leaf. Defaults to 3 minutes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="animations">Animations</h2>
    
    <p>A Pikmin type needs to have the following animations:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b><code>attacking</code></b>: If its attack method is "latch", this is the Pikmin reeling back its head and smacking with it, causing damage; this is used regardless of the Pikmin being latched on or attacking while grounded. If its attack method is "impact", this is the Pikmin lunging forward and causing damage; it should be quick and snappy so the Pikmin can be bounced back shortly after.</li>
      <li><b><code>carrying</code></b>: Carrying an object.</li>
      <li><b><code>drinking</code></b>: Bending down to drink a drop.</li>
      <li><b><code>getting_up</code></b>: Getting up from lying down.</li>
      <li><b><code>grabbing</code></b>: Standing upright and grabbing onto an object.</li>
      <li><b><code>knocked_back</code></b>: Getting knocked backwards, flying in the air.</li>
      <li><b><code>lying</code></b>: On the ground due to having been knocked down by an attack.</li>
      <li><b><code>mob_landing</code></b>: Getting ready to strike after landing on an object and latching on. Alternatively, causing damage after landing on an object.</li>
      <li><b><code>plucking</code></b>: Coming out of the ground.</li>
      <li><b><code>sighing</code></b>: Sighing after becoming disappointed with something, like being unable to reach a carrying spot.</li>
      <li><b><code>sprout</code></b>: Idling underground; only the stem is visible.</li>
      <li><b><code>thrown</code></b>: Twirling in the air after being thrown.</li>
      <li><b><code>walking</code></b>: Walking.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="script">Script</h2>
    
    <p>Pikmin types have hardcoded <a href="script.html">scripts</a>, so the only thing you can do is enhance them.</p>

    <p>Some <a href="script.html#vars">script variables</a> control special behavior, like the Pikmin's starting maturity. To know which ones exist, you can go to the area editor, select a Pikmin, and read the tooltip of each variable.</p>
