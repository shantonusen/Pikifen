    <p>A <b>treasure</b> refers to any main collectible that the Pikmin can deliver back to the ship. These are the ship parts in <i>Pikmin</i>, the treasures in <i>Pikmin 2</i>, and the fruits in <i>Pikmin 3</i>.</p>

    <p>Examples of treasure types include the Main Engine, the Courage Reactor, and the Sunseed Berry.</p>

    <p>To create a new type of treasure, please follow the <a href="mob_type.html">making object types tutorial</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

    <p>A treasure type object simply has logic to be carried, and to give a different value of points. The only other important parts of the treasure are their radius and weight.</p>

    <p>Treasure type objects are hardcoded in the engine to sit there, be carried, be delivered to a ship, and give out some number of points.</p>

    <h2 id="props">Properties</h2>

    <p>Besides the <a href="mob_type.html#creating">global object type properties</a>, a treasure type has the following properties.</p>

    <h3 id="mandatory">Mandatory</h3>

    <p>None.</p>

    <h3 id="recommended">Recommended</h3>

    <ul>
      <li><b><code>points</code></b>: How many points the treasure is worth when salvaged. Defaults to 10.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="optional">Optional</h3>

    <p>None.</p>

    <h2 id="animations">Animations</h2>

    <p>A treasure type needs to have the following animations:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><b><code>idling</code></b>: Idling; used for everything.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="script">Script</h2>

    <p>Treasure types have hardcoded <a href="script.html">scripts</a>, so the only thing you can do is enhance them.</p>

    <p>Some <a href="script.html#vars">script variables</a> control special behavior, like the treasure's starting team. To know which ones exist, you can go to the area editor, select a treasure, and read the tooltip of each variable.</p>
