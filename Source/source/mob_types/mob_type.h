/* A mob type that has animation groups.

 * So in practice, it can have an idling blue animation, idling yellow,
 * dying red, etc. Because this would otherwise be a nightmare to organize,
 * this base class comes with some helpful functions and members.
 * A "group" is the "look" mentioned before, so "red", "yellow", "blue", etc.
 * The mob type should load a property somewhere that lists what suffixes to
