    <h1>Object types</h1>
    
    <p>This page will instruct you on how to make object types in <i>Pikifen</i>. This includes a type of enemy, type of Pikmin, etc.</p>

    <h2 id="idea">General idea</h2>
    
    <p>In order for the engine to detect a type of object, it will check the <code>Game_data/Types</code> folder. Inside are several folders, one for each category of object (enemies, gates, etc.). Inside each category are folders for the different types of objects (the different types of enemies, different types of leaders, etc.). Finally, inside those are some <a href="text_file.html">text files</a> with data about how the object works, its animations, or its script.</p>

    <h2 id="creating">Creating a new object type</h2>
    
    <p>To create a new object type, make a folder for it in the right category, and create an empty text files inside called <code>Data.txt</code>. Inside, you will write all of the object's properties, like the name, its movement speed, etc. These take on the form of <code>property = value</code>, and there is one property per line. So for instance, to name Louie's object type, you'd have the line <code>name = Louie</code> in the file.</p>

    <p>Some properties are mandatory, some are optional, some apply to all object types, and some only apply to certain categories of object type. You can get a list of properties that apply to all object types in the following sub-sections of this page, and then check what properties exist for that category by visiting the category's article from the <a href="#mob-list">list</a>. After you're done setting the properties, you must create the animations for the object type; use the <a href="animation.html">animation tutorial</a> for this. Finally, some object types will also need a script to run. To figure out if your object will need a script or not, check the <a href="#mob-list">list of categories</a> and if it does, read the <a href="script.html">object script tutorial</a> to learn what you need to do.</p>

    <p>After you have done that, you can boot up the engine, go to the area editor, place your new object in an area, hit play, and watch it in action!</p>

    <p>Naturally, instead of creating your own files from scratch, you may copy and paste an existing object's files and simply edit those.</p>

    <h3 id="manadtory-props">Mandatory properties</h3>
    
    <p>The following properties <b>must</b> exist, regardless of category.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b><code>name</code></b>: Name of the object type. e.g. "Olimar", "Red Pikmin", "Cloaking Burrow-nit".</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="recommended-props">Recommended properties</h3>
    
    <p>The following are properties that you really should have, but the engine can run without them.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b><code>can_hunt</code></b>: This object will only want to hunt down objects of this target type. i.e. it will only consider those an "opponent" (provided they're also in an opposing team). See <code>target_type</code> below for more information. Defaults to "player" and "enemy".</li>
      <li><b><code>can_hurt</code></b>: This object can only cause damage to objects of this target type (provided they're also in an opposing team). See <code>target_type</code> below for more information. Defaults to "player", "enemy", and "fragile".</li>
      <li><b><code>height</code></b>: Object's height. This doesn't need to be <i>very</i> specific. For reference, leaders are usually 32, Pikmin are usually 24. Defaults to 0.</li>
      <li><b><code>max_health</code></b>: The object's top health. For reference, leaders have 2000, and something like a Red Bulborb has 750. Defaults to 100.</li>
      <li><b><code>move_speed</code></b>: Standard movement speed (in pixels per second). For reference, leaders move at 130. Defaults to 0.</li>
      <li><b><code>pushable</code></b>: <code>true</code> if this object can be pushed out of the way by other objects. <code>false</code> otherwise. Defaults to false.</li>
      <li><b><code>pushes</code></b>: <code>true</code> if this object can push "pushable" objects out of the way. <code>false</code> otherwise. Defaults to false.</li>
      <li><b><code>radius</code></b>: The object's size, represented by the circle's radius (in pixels). Leaders are 32 pixels wide, so their radius is 16. Pikmin have a radius of 10. Defaults to 0.</li>
      <li><b><code>rotation_speed</code></b>: How fast the object turns when moving, in degrees per second. For reference, leaders use around 360, Pikmin use around 630, and a Red Bulborb uses around 114. Defaults to 630.</li>
      <li>
        <b><code>target_type</code></b>: What type of "target" the object is. This determines which objects will hunt it, and which objects can attack it. Possible values are as follows, along with what each type is meant to represent. Defaults to "none".
        <ul>
          <li><code>none</code>: Cannot be damaged or hunted down.</li>
          <li><code>player</code>: Leaders, Pikmin, and anything belonging to the "heroes" of the player's side.</li>
          <li><code>enemy</code>: Enemies.</li>
          <li><code>weak_plain_obstacle</code>: Weaker objects that should be damaged by many things, like leaders, Pikmin, or explosions. e.g. egg.</li>
          <li><code>strong_plain_obstacle</code>: Stronger objects that should be damaged by beefy hits, like Pikmin or explosions. e.g. gas pipe.</li>
          <li><code>pikmin_obstacle</code>: An object only Pikmin should harm. e.g. electric gate.</li>
          <li><code>explodable</code>: An object that should only be hurt by an explosion. e.g. reinforced wall.</li>
          <li><code>explodable_pikmin_obstacle</code>: An object that should be hurt by Pikmin or explosives only. e.g. Burgeoning Spiderwort.</li>
          <li><code>fragile</code>: A fragile object that should be harmed by even the gentlest smack. e.g. bomb rock.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><code>team</code></b>: Sets the object's team. Objects in the same team will not hunt or harm each other. Default depends on the object's category. Valid values are:
        <ul>
          <li><code>none</code>: Does not belong to a team.</li>
          <li><code>player_X</code>: Belongs to player 1, 2, 3, or 4's team (replace the X with a number). Usually used for leaders and Pikmin.</li>
          <li><code>enemy_X</code>: Belongs to the enemy team 1, 2, 3, or 4 (replace the X with a number).</li>
          <li><code>obstacle</code>: Obstacle team.</li>
          <li><code>other</code>: Team for whatever else.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="optional-props">Optional properties</h3>
    
    <p>For all categories of object type, you may set these properties, but they will still work if you don't.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b><code>acceleration</code></b>: How quickly the object reaches top speed when moving. This is in units per second per second. Default is 400.</li>
      <li><b><code>can_block_paths</code></b>: If set to <code>true</code>, this object blocks objects following the path it is on, like a closed gate or an unbuilt bridge. If the object finishes dying, it will stop blocking, though it can also start and stop blocking at will according to its script. Defaults to false.</li>
      <li><b><code>can_free_move</code></b>: If true, this object can move in any direction freely, without having to first turn there. It will also not face towards the direction it is going. Defaults to false.</li>
      <li><b><code>casts_shadow</code></b>: If set to <code>false</code>, the object won't cast a shadow on the ground. Defaults to true.</li>
      <li><b><code>default_vulnerability</code></b>: For every source of damage not specified in the <a href="#vulnerabilities">vulnerabilities</a>, the damage the object receives is multiplied by this amount. Defaults to 1.</li>
      <li><b><code>has_group</code></b>: If true, this object can have a group of other objects (usually a group of Pikmin) following behind it, likely via the <code>follow_link_as_leader</code> <a href="script.html">script variable</a>. Without this property, it can't have other objects following it.</li>
      <li><b><code>health_regen</code></b>: Passive health regeneration rate, in HP per second. Defaults to 0.</li>
      <li><b><code>itch_damage</code></b>: If an enemy has taken this much damage, it will be considered "itchy". With this, you can listen to the <code>on_itch</code> event, and when it triggers, make the enemy shake the Pikmin off. Handling this event automatically resets the amount of damage, making it possible for the enemy to be itchy again, next time it takes this amount of damage. Setting this to something like 10% or 20% of the max health is usually the way to go. Defaults to 0.</li>
      <li><b><code>itch_time</code></b>: In order for the enemy to not shake over and over, if you keep damaging it, you can also specify a minimum time requirement between itches, in seconds. Defaults to 0.</li>
      <li><b><code>main_color</code></b>: A color to represent the object by. The format is <code>R G B</code> (values range from 0 to 255). Defaults to black.</li>
      <li><b><code>max_carriers</code></b>: Maximum number of Pikmin that can carry this object, when it is made carriable. Defaults to 0.</li>
      <li><b><code>pushes_with_hitboxes</code></b>: If true, this object pushes with its (normal or attack) hitboxes, instead of pushing using its object's center and radius. Defaults to false.</li>
      <li><b><code>rectangular_dimensions</code></b>: If this object is meant to have rectangular collision, specify the rectangle's dimensions here, in the format <code>&lt;width&gt; &lt;height&gt;</code>. This is useful for objects like gates, but shouldn't be used by objects that can move (among other things, the engine is not ready to handle rectangular object vs rectangular object collisions). Defaults to no rectangular dimensions.</li>
      <li><b><code>show_health</code></b>: If set to <code>false</code>, the object's health wheel will not appear on top of it. Defaults to true.</li>
      <li><b><code>spike_damage</code></b>: If this object is meant to cause <a href="misc_features.html">spike damage</a>, specify the spike damage type's name here. Defaults to none.</li>
      <li><b><code>spike_damage_vulnerabilities</code></b>: Normally, objects hit by a spike damage attack will receive the damage specified by the attack's type. If you want this mob type to take more or less damage instead, or even receive a status effect, you can specify it here. This property is a block, and the format is the same as the <a href="#vulnerabilities">regular damage vulnerabilities property</a>. Defaults to not set.</li>
      <li><b><code>territory_radius</code></b>: How far away from the spawn point must the enemy be before being considered "far from home". For reference, a Red Bulborb has this set to 500. Defaults to 0.</li>
      <li><b><code>walkable</code></b>: If <code>true</code>, this object can be walked on top of by other objects. Other objects will be able to mount it if they fall on it from above, or if they are on a floor that's within 50 units of height from the top of this object (much like how climbing up <a href="area.html#ramps">stairs</a> work). Defaults to false.</li>
      <li><b><code>weight</code></b>: How much Pikmin strength does it take to carry the object. Defaults to 0.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If there's a type of object you know is popular in the <i>Pikmin</i> series, but you can't find the category for it, then either an appropriate category does not yet exist in the engine, or it can be created as a custom object.</p>

    <h2 id="extra">Extra features</h2>

    <h3 id="reaches">Reaches</h3>

    <p>An object can detect whether another object is "within reach" or not. Also, if it was within reach, and became "out of reach". It can also use different definitions of "reach" for different moments. This is all explained in detail in the <a href="script.html#reach">script page</a>.</p>
    
    <h3 id="spawning">Spawning other objects</h3>
    
    <p>If you want your object to spawn other objects, you need to specify their spawn data. In <code>Data.txt</code>, include a block titled <code>spawns</code>. Inside, you will write a series of blocks, each one with a unique name that will identify that spawn data. Later, when you want to spawn an object using the <a href="script.html">script</a>, you need to refer to this name.</p>

    <p>These spawn data blocks must have the following properties inside:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><b><code>object</code></b>: Name of the type of object to be spawned. This is the formal name, i.e. the name provided in the <code>name</code> property in the mob type's <code>Data.txt</code> file.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It can also optionally have these properties:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><b><code>relative</code></b>: Are the specified spawn coordinates absolute or relative? See <a href="script.html#rel-coords">here</a> for more help.</li>
      <li><b><code>coordinates</code></b>: Coordinates to spawn in, in the format <code>x y z</code>.</li>
      <li><b><code>angle</code></b>: Angle the spawned object will be facing.</li>
      <li><b><code>momentum</code></b>: If this is 0, the mob spawns in the exact spot specified and stand there. Otherwise, it will spawn in that spot but be launched in a random direction, with the specified momentum. 100 is a good general case value.</li>
      <li><b><code>vars</code></b>: Any <a href="script.html#vars">script variables</a> to include, separated by semicolon. Example: <code>vars = maturity = 0; sprout = true</code>.</li>
      <li><b><code>link_spawn_to_object</code></b>: If <code>true</code>, a <a href="misc_features.html#mob-links">link</a> will be created from the spawned object to your object.</li>
      <li><b><code>link_object_to_spawn</code></b>: If <code>true</code>, a link will be created from your object to the spawned object.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="parent">Parent/child objects</h3>
    
    <p>Your object can be a <b>parent</b> object, meaning it is actually composed of several different <b>child</b> objects. This feature is especially useful when you need several independently-moving parts. For instance, in a <a href="https://www.pikminwiki.com/Beady_Long_Legs">Beady Long Legs</a>, the head is the parent object, meaning it is the enemy proper, and each leg is a child object.</p>

    <p>A parent will spawn its children at the same time that it itself is spawned. Because every child is meant to be its own individual thing but also serve as components of the parent object, there are several ways for you to specify what it should do when it interacts with the world. This means specifying what happens when it receives damage, receives a script event, or receives a status effect: it can either ignore what it received or not, and it can either relay it to the parent object or not.</p>

    <p>Children objects can also be connected to a specific body part in the parent. Because children objects are commonly used as appendages of the creature, it is possible to draw a "limb" connecting a parent object to a child object. This limb is a rectangular shaped sprite that stretches and rotates accordingly.</p>

    <p>To make your object type a parent, go to <code>Data.txt</code>, and add a block called <code>children</code>. Inside, you will include a series of blocks, each one with a unique name that represents the child, e.g. "left_foot". Now, when your object is spawned, it will spawn these children along with it. Each of these children blocks needs to have the following properties:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><b><code>spawn</code></b>: Name of the <a href="#spawning">spawn data</a> to use.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The blocks can also have the following optional properties:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><b><code>parent_holds</code></b>: If <code>true</code>, then the parent object is holding this one, much like an enemy holds a Pikmin that is latched on to it. Use the following properties to specify the location.</li>
      <li><b><code>hold_body_part</code></b>: If the parent holds this child, this is the name of the body part it is held on. If empty, the center of the parent object is used instead.</li>
      <li><b><code>hold_offset_distance</code></b>: If the parent holds this child, this is how far away from the center of the body part/object the child is. 0 means dead center, and 1 means on the edge, but you can write numbers beyond this range.</li>
      <li><b><code>hold_offset_angle</code></b>: If the parent holds this child, this is the angle from the body part/object's default position that the child is located at.</li>
      <li><b><code>hold_rotation_method</code></b>: Indicates how the child can rotate. <code>never</code> means it never rotates (besides the starting angle). <code>face_parent</code> means it always rotates to face the center of the parent object. <code>copy_parent</code> means it's always the same angle as the parent object. Defaults to never.</li>
      <li><b><code>handle_damage</code></b>: If <code>true</code>, the child object loses health when it receives damage. If <code>false</code>, it ignores the damage.</li>
      <li><b><code>relay_damage</code></b>: If <code>true</code>, the child object relays any damage to the parent object, so <i>it</i> can handle it.</li>
      <li><b><code>handle_events</code></b>: If <code>true</code>, the child object handles any script event that it receives. If <code>false</code>, it ignores the event.</li>
      <li><b><code>relay_events</code></b>: If <code>true</code>, the child object relays any events received to the parent object, so <i>it</i> can handle them.</li>
      <li><b><code>handle_statuses</code></b>: If <code>true</code>, the child object handles any status effect that it receives. If <code>false</code>, it ignores the status.</li>
      <li><b><code>relay_statuses</code></b>: If <code>true</code>, the child object relays any status effects received to the parent object, so <i>it</i> can handle them.</li>
      <li><b><code>limb_animation</code></b>: If there is meant to be a "limb" drawn between the child and parent, specify the name of its <a href="animation.html">animation</a> here. This animation must be included in the parent object's animation set.</li>
      <li><b><code>limb_thickness</code></b>: If there is a limb, this specifies how thick it is.</li>
      <li><b><code>limb_parent_body_part</code></b>: If there is a limb, this specifies where it connects to in the parent. If it's empty, it connects to the parent's center. Otherwise, it connects to the center of the specified body part.</li>
      <li><b><code>limb_parent_offset</code></b>: If there is a limb, you can specify how far away it is from the center of the parent-side connection.</li>
      <li><b><code>limb_child_body_part</code></b>: Same as <code>limb_parent_body_part</code>, but for the child object.</li>
      <li><b><code>limb_child_offset</code></b>: Same as <code>limb_parent_offset</code>, but for the child object.</li>
      <li>
        <b><code>limb_draw_method</code></b>: How to draw the limb. This can be one of the following:

    <h3 id="vulnerabilities">Vulnerabilities</h3>
    
    <p>You can make it so that an object is completely invulnerable to a hazard, more vulnerable to another, etc.</p>

    <p>In <code>Data.txt</code>, add a block titled <code>vulnerabilities</code>. Inside, each property has the hazard's name as its name, and the vulnerability data as its value, e.g. <code>fire = 50 sweating true</code>. The vulnerability data consists of one to three words:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The first word is the damage percentage. When the object is hurt by an attack with this hazard, its damage will be changed by the specified percentage, so 50 would make it take half damage. You can make this negative to get the object to heal instead! If this value is 0, the object will completely ignore this hazard in its entirety, even if it's not an attack.</li>
      <li>The second word, optional, is the name of a status effect. When the object interacts with this hazard, it will receive this status effect.</li>
      <li>The third word, also optional, controls whether the status effect overrides others. If true, then the object will <i>only</i> receive the status effect from the previous word, and will not receive the status effect the hazard usually gives. If false or not specified, then the object will <i>also</i> receive this status effect on top of any others the hazard gives.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can use this in conjunction with the <code>default_vulnerability</code> <a href="optional-props">property</a> to make an object that is invulnerable to anything except explosions, for instance.</p>
    
    <h3 id="area-editor-tips">Area editor tips</h3>
    
    <p>Some objects require certain things to be set up in certain ways in the area editor before they work as intended. e.g. bridges must be on a bridge sector, seesaw blocks need to link to each other before they work together, etc. Users who are not very familiar with these tricks may take a while to realize what's wrong. To help with this, you can also specify a property that, when read by the area editor, will make it display a specific widget. This widget, when the user places their mouse over it, will show some helpful tips about how to make use of the object.</p>
    
    <p>In <code>Data.txt</code>, add a property titled <code>area_editor_tips</code>. Then, simply write the tip(s) you want as the value. Remember that these are displayed in a tooltip, and if you don't keep it short, or cut your text into multiple lines, it will all be in one large line, which may not even fit on-screen. To add a line break, write <code>\n</code> in your text. To write a literal backslash, you will need to type <code>\\</code>.
    
    <h3 id="area-editor-props">Area editor properties</h3>
    
    <p>Some object types can make use of <a href="script.html#vars">script variables</a> to make specific objects have different behavior. For instance, with script variables, you can place two Pellet Posies in an area, and one of them can start already fully bloomed. When an object spawns, the engine itself or the object's script may read any declared script variables and use them as they see fit. In the area editor, you can write down the script variables you want a specific object to declare, along with their values, but having to memorize the names of the variables &ndash; as well as what each value means &ndash; is a bit of a pain. To remedy this, you can add some properties to the object type's data with information about important script variables. Then, when the area editor loads, it will use that information to present the user with some helpful widgets to set those special behaviors with, each widget in charge of one script variable.</p>
    
    <p>In <code>Data.txt</code>, add a block titled <code>area_editor_properties</code>. Inside, you will write one block per script variable, with each block's name being the name of the widget responsible. Then, add the following properties as needed:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><b><code>var</code></b>: The name of the variable, as used in the script.</li>
      <li>
        <b><code>type</code></b>: What type of variable this is. Can be one of the following:
        <ul>
          <li><code>text</code>: The variable is meant to be text. The widget will be a text box. Use this when the other types won't cut it, so that the user is free to write whatever they need in the text box.</li>
          <li><code>int</code>: The variable is meant to be an integer number. The widget will be a number box with integers.</li>
          <li><code>decimal</code>: The variable is meant to be a decimal number. The widget will be a number box with decimal numbers.</li>
          <li><code>bool</code>: The variable is meant to be true or false. The widget will be a checkbox.</li>
          <li><code>list</code>: The variable is meant to be text. The widget will be a list box with several choices to choose from.</li>
          <li><code>number_list</code>: The variable is meant to be an integer number. The widget will be a list box with several choices, where each choice maps to a number.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b><code>def_value</code></b>: The variable's default value, as used in the script.</li>
      <li><b><code>min_value</code></b>: For variables meant to be integer or decimal numbers, this is the minimum value it is meant to have. The widget will not let the user pick a number beyond this one.</li>
      <li><b><code>max_value</code></b>: Same as <code>min_value</code>, but for the maximum.</li>
      <li><b><code>list</code></b>: For list widgets, this is the list of choices, separated by semicolon (;). If the variable is meant to be an integer, the first option maps to 0, the second to 1, etc.</li>
      <li><b><code>tooltip</code></b>: Tooltip to display when the user places their mouse cursor on top of the widget. Use this to explain what the variable means, to provide extra info, to give special instructions, etc.</li>
    </ul>

        If objects of your new type are not being hunted down or hurt, confirm the following:
        <ul>
          <li>The object's target type is one of the types the attacker wants to hunt or can hurt.</li>
          <li>The object is not in the same team as the attacker.</li>
          <li>The object has more than zero health.</li>
          <li>The object is not unhuntable via the <code>set_huntable</code> <a href="script.html">script action</a>.</li>
          <li>The object is not invisible via a <a href="status.html">status effect</a>.</li>
