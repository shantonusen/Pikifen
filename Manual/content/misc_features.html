    <p>This page will describe several miscellaneous features in <i>Pikifen</i> that don't quite fit in other pages.</p>

    <h2 id="mob-links">Object links</h2>
    
    <p>You can make one object in the area have a link towards another object. This allows one object to send messages to its links, with the appropriate <a href="script.html">script actions</a>. It also makes it possible for the engine to know how certain special objects should function, when they need to know data about a second object. Connections are one-way, so if you want object A to send messages to object B and vice-versa, you will need to create a link from B to A as well.</p>

    <p>To link an object to another, you can either link them in the <a href="area.html#linked-mobs">area editor</a>, or when an object is <a href="mob_type.html#spawning">spawning another</a>. In the latter case, you can specify if you want the link to be from the spawner object to the spawned object, the opposite, or both.
