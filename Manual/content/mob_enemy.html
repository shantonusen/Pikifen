    <b>Enemies</b> are any type of object that can attack or be attacked by the Pikmin.

    <p>Examples of enemy types include Red Bulborbs, Water Dumples, White Spectralids, etc.</p>

    <p>To create a new type of enemy, please follow the <a href="mob_type.html">making object types tutorial</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

    <p>An enemy is something that a Pikmin will consider an opponent, and will want to attack. Depending on how the enemy is scripted, it can also want to attack the Pikmin, run away from them, ignore them, etc. Once killed, an enemy can drop a corpse, which can then be carried to an Onion to give Pikmin seeds. Because enemies can have many varied behaviors, most of what they do is controlled by the script.</p>

    <h2 id="props">Properties</h2>

    <p>Besides the <a href="mob_type.html#creating">global object type properties</a>, an enemy type has the following properties.</p>

    <h3 id="mandatory">Mandatory</h3>

    <p>None.</p>

    <h3 id="recommended">Recommended</h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li><b><code>allow_ground_attacks</code></b>: <code>false</code> makes it so that Pikmin cannot attack it with grounded attacks; the only way to hurt it is by throwing Pikmin and letting them attack latched on. Defaults to true.</li>
      <li><b><code>drops_corpse</code></b>: <code>true</code> if this enemy drops a corpse, <code>false</code> otherwise. Defaults to true.</li>
      <li><b><code>pikmin_seeds</code></b>: How many seeds this enemy gives when the corpse is returned to the Onion. Defaults to 0.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="optional">Optional</h3>

    <p>None.</p>

    <h2 id="animations">Animations</h2>

    <p>Enemy object types do not need any specific animations, only the ones that you call in the script.</p>

    <h2 id="script">Script</h2>

    <p>All of the enemy type object's behavior is defined by the user-made <a href="script.html">script</a>. There are no recommended states, events, or actions.</p>

    <p>Some <a href="script.html#vars">script variables</a> control special behavior, like the enemy's spoils upon death. To know which ones exist, you can go to the area editor, select an enemy, and read the tooltip of each variable.</p>
